**Standard 1:**
**9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.**

**Standard 2:**
**9-12.CT.4 Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.**

**Associated lesson or activity:**
For this standard students completed a project where they designed a program simulating an ATM machine.  Here students had to simulate how a user would "deposit" or take out money from the machine, at the same time adding or subtracting from their overall balance.  The things they had take into consideraton while completing this assignment were:
- how much money is in the machine
- the maximum withdrawal amount allowed by Federal guidelines
- out-of-network transaction fees and charges

Students had to think about the logic behind this as well as what message should be displayed to the user if the machine needs servicing.
As I graded this assignment it was interesting to see how students' coding styles developed, as well as how they thought the program should be run.
