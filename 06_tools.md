**Tools I use in the Classroom**

I use quite a few tools in my classes.  For the hardware piece, I use:
- Chromebooks
- Windows laptops
- Linux laptops (Zorin Linux)

For Chromebooks, I need to adapt my lessons to them because all of my students have their own Chromebook provided by the school.  It is challenging at times, especially since not many things are adaptable to Chromebooks.  I use them for the students to complete general tasks on Google Classroom, such as completing assignments, quizzes or even completing surveys.  Unfortunately, I did not select to use these.  I would have preferred if students had their **_own laptops_** instead of Chromebooks.

Windows laptops are easier to use and I have two class sets of them, one in my section of the STEAM lab and another for my normal classroom.  The ones in the STEAM lab are for my Computer Science students.  The ones in my classroom are for my Computer Applications class who are learning about how to use Microsoft Office 365.  I need these because the Office online version my students are currently using is very limited in functionality.  There are some things that that Office online cannot offer that a normal laptop can offer with a full version of Microsoft Office.

Linux laptops are another class set of computers I have in my room.  These are for my 8th graders who I teach Tech 8.  We will have a coding unit after electronics where students will learn about Linux and how to use Python scripts using the Linux terminal.  They will also be learning basic command line functions to navigate through the filesystem of Linux.  Zorin is the only version of Linux these computers can have because of their age.  They are old and somewhat slow.
