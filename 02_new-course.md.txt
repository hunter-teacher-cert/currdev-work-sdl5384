**New course I would like to teach**

If I had the opportunity to teach a new computer science course at school would be an Intro to Introduction to Computer Modeling course, as well as an Introduction to Computer Animation course.

**Description 1**
This course would introduce students to coding in Python.  Students will have the opportunity to learn how to use Python in modeling different scenarios both in a social setting and a physical setting.  Students will learn different analytical techniques to search for patterns and visualize it using different features in Python.

**Description 2**
This course would introduce students to coding in Python.  Students will learn how to use the features of Python itself, such as Tkinter, Processing by Python, and others.  Students will learn the basics of creating shapes and learn how to make objects both in a 2D or 3D setting.  Students will also learn how different transformations used in making objects move, such as Bezier and spline curves.

Students will be assessed not only by their mastery, but their creativity and efforts in their final projects as well.  Students should have taken at least one Algebra course as well as Geometry.

**Target Audience both courses**
This class will be mainly designed to high school students who show interest in this field and/or have already taken the Computer Science course offered at the school.  It would be preferred if students have at least taken and passed Algebra.

**Where it fits**
Both courses would fit with both the STEAM Lab program that is going on at our school, but they would also closely align with the Computer Science course already offered at the school as well.
