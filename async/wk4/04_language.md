**Possible languages that can be taught in CS schools**

Another language I would consider teaching outside the ones I know and teach now is **HTML and CSS with JavaScript**.

**What is the course? (grade level, student experience)**
It would be a high school course, grades 10 through 12.  Computer Science course hosted by the Community College, which is what I am doing now, but with Python. 

**How does one with write and run code in the language**
From what I can see, one can write the code in this language fairly easily.  Variable declaration is fairly flexibly in JavaScript.  You do not need to ***specifically state*** what data type each variable you create and use is.  JavaScript will automatically take care of that for you.

**Strength**
As previously mentioned, it is fairly easy to pick up and interactive, especially with the **alert()** function which allows one to have the browser immediately interact and send messages to the user in case it needs further input or in case something goes wrong.

**How would you utilize the strengths in the class?**
(A) This question to me was a little unclear, but I will be happy to briefly discuss *both* aspects:
In the case of the strengths of the language itself:

It is easy to learn and pick up.  You can generalize lessons better by discussing topics without having to get into too much detail such as variables (again, no specific data types need to be declared from my impression).  I think at the same time students will have an easier time to understand it as well.  They will have fun with this.

(B) In the case of the students' strengths and abilities, I believe this language is fairly reachable to **ALL** students.  The ones more capable will excel through it easily, but the ones who will take longer or who have learning disabilities I think will not have too hard of a time because it is rather simple to write code with.  I am still looking into it myself and learning about JavaScript.

JavaScript is very popular and can be used with other languages as well.

**Weaknesses and how I would mitigate them**
Even though JavaScript itself is easy to work with, it does come with drawbacks.  I have been researching what some of these are outside the site listed and the one thing that caught my eye was that there is a lack of *debugging facilities*.  This means basically that if there is an error in the code, something may not run right or run the way it was meant to be and it would be very difficult for the coder to find out where the error is in the code.

A single error can also stop the website from rendering, which would be even more frustrating.  Especially with slow learners or students who have disabilities, this can be devastatingly frustrating.

It can run by itself outside HTML, but so far the only thing I see that you would need is **Node.js**.  I have only *heard* of Node.js.  I don't exactly understand what it's purpose is per se in coding with JavaScript, let alone understand how it works.  Having said that, I would be limited to HTML for JavaScript.  The tags in HTML can especially be tedious in many cases because it is easy to forget to make sure you have **both** ends of your text marked up with HTML tags.

**Why did I select JavaScript?**
Why I chose JavaScript was because I always wanted to learn a web based language.  I learned Java. I learned Python, and I learned VBA in Excel.  I am ready to take my coding (and teaching prowess) to the next level, which is web design and coding.  I tried to learn it a while ago but I stoppec for some reason.  But after this program, I ready to pick it back up again and master it. Then help my students master it.  **And have fun with!**
